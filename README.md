Hi there! Thanks for dropping by my profile page 🐕‍🦺<br><br>

### My go-to tool kit

I consider web platforms increasingly powerful and demonstrate this through my projects. TypeScript, serving as both the foundation for my work and the tools I build with, has become my go-to programming language for its flexibility. While The same can be said for Rust and WebAssembly, while I'm relatively inexperienced with it, I found it intuitive and its low-level control and strict typing, makes it a powerful tool for client-side computation.

### Me, personaly

My name Markus, I go by Milo in English-speaking communities, and I'm a now junior web and software developer based in Germany, focusing on full-stack development with Rust, WebAssembly, and TypeScript. I completed my studies as a "Fachinformatiker/-in Fachrichtung: Anwendungsentwicklung" (Computer Science Expert in the Subject Area of Software Development) in Heidelberg, Germany, in 2023.

#### What's behind the service dog –

<!--
-# secret notes; I am not joking when I compare myself to a service dog ^^'

**Adaptability**: I am comfortable working in various situations and can adapt to different technologies, frameworks, and project needs, ensuring that I can contribute effectively to any team.

**Supportive Nature**: I support my team by navigating technical challenges, collaborating on goals, and sharing my knowledge about the technologies I work with, driven by a passion for teaching.

**Calm Temperament**: I keep a calm demeanor and react appropriately to unexpected challenges or changes in project requirements.

**Focus and Attention**: I maintain a high level of attention to detail and stay focused on my tasks, even in difficult and fast-paced development environment.

You might see me use the 🐕‍🦺 *emoji* and/with the phrase *"soft as a developer"* at times. This prase is a playful take on "software developer" reflects my openness and personal interest in assistive technologies and their design principles. I firmly believe that integrating accessibility should be inherent step to any design from the outset, and I am committed to creating solutions that are both dependable and a guide, similar to a service dog.

#### Examples of my work –

My [pinned repositories](https://github.com/milotheirself#user-54866561-pinned-items-reorder-form) showcase some of my projects, take a look! Aside from those I would also like highlight some of the programming assignment I completed during my studies. They aren't good by any messure, but I still see them quick examples for how I intuitivly approached and solved problems even with limited programming experience I had back when I wrote them in 2022.
